Realtime
Communicate with a multimodal model in real time over low latency interfaces like WebRTC, WebSocket, and SIP. Natively supports speech-to-speech as well as text, image, and audio inputs and outputs.

Learn more about the Realtime API.

Client secrets
REST API endpoint to generate ephemeral client secrets for use in client-side applications. Client secrets are short-lived tokens that can be passed to a client app, such as a web frontend or mobile client, which grants access to the Realtime API without leaking your main API key. You can configure a custom TTL for each client secret.

You can also attach session configuration options to the client secret, which will be applied to any sessions created using that client secret, but these can also be overridden by the client connection.

Learn more about authentication with client secrets over WebRTC.

https://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/client_secrets
Create a Realtime client secret with an associated session configuration.

Request body
expires_after
object

Optional
Configuration for the client secret expiration. Expiration refers to the time after which a client secret will no longer be valid for creating sessions. The session itself may continue after that time once started. A secret can be used to create multiple sessions until it expires.

Client events
These are events that the OpenAI Realtime WebSocket server will accept from the client.

session.update
Send this event to update the sessionâ€™s configuration. The client may send this event at any time to update any field except for voice and model. voice can be updated only if there have been no other audio outputs yet.

When the server receives a session.update, it will respond with a session.updated event showing the full, effective configuration. Only the fields that are present in the session.update are updated. To clear a field like instructions, pass an empty string. To clear a field like tools, pass an empty array. To clear a field like turn_detection, pass null.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event. This is an arbitrary string that a client may assign. It will be passed back if there is an error with the event, but the corresponding session.updated event will not include it.

session
object

Update the Realtime session. Choose either a realtime session or a transcription session.

  },
  "event_id": "5fc543c4-f59c-420f-8fb9-68c45d1546a7",
}
input_audio_buffer.append
Send this event to append audio bytes to the input audio buffer. The audio buffer is temporary storage you can write to and later commit. A "commit" will create a new user message item in the conversation history from the buffer content and clear the buffer. Input audio transcription (if enabled) will be generated when the buffer is committed.

If VAD is enabled the audio buffer is used to detect speech and the server will decide when to commit. When Server VAD is disabled, you must commit the audio buffer manually. Input audio noise reduction operates on writes to the audio buffer.

The client may choose how much audio to place in each event up to a maximum of 15 MiB, for example streaming smaller chunks from the client may allow the VAD to be more responsive. Unlike most other client events, the server will not send a confirmation response to this event.

audio
string

Base64-encoded audio bytes. This must be in the format specified by the input_audio_format field in the session configuration.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.append.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.append
{
    "event_id": "event_456",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.append",
    "audio": "Base64EncodedAudioData"
}
input_audio_buffer.commit
Send this event to commit the user input audio buffer, which will create a new user message item in the conversation. This event will produce an error if the input audio buffer is empty. When in Server VAD mode, the client does not need to send this event, the server will commit the audio buffer automatically.

Committing the input audio buffer will trigger input audio transcription (if enabled in session configuration), but it will not create a response from the model. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.committed event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.commit.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.commit
{
    "event_id": "event_789",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.commit"
}
input_audio_buffer.clear
Send this event to clear the audio bytes in the buffer. The server will respond with an input_audio_buffer.cleared event.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

type
string

The event type, must be input_audio_buffer.clear.

OBJECT input_audio_buffer.clear
{
    "event_id": "event_012",
    "type": "input_audio_buffer.clear"
}
conversation.item.create
Add a new Item to the Conversation's context, including messages, function calls, and function call responses. This event can be used both to populate a "history" of the conversation and to add new items mid-stream, but has the current limitation that it cannot populate assistant audio messages.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.created event, otherwise an error event will be sent.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item
object

A single item within a Realtime conversation.


Show possible types
previous_item_id
string

The ID of the preceding item after which the new item will be inserted. If not set, the new item will be appended to the end of the conversation. If set to root, the new item will be added to the beginning of the conversation. If set to an existing ID, it allows an item to be inserted mid-conversation. If the ID cannot be found, an error will be returned and the item will not be added.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.create.

OBJECT conversation.item.create
{
  "type": "conversation.item.create",
  "item": {
    "type": "message",
    "role": "user",

    ]
  },
  "event_id": "b904fba0-0ec4-40af-8bbb-f908a9b26793",
}
conversation.item.retrieve
Send this event when you want to retrieve the server's representation of a specific item in the conversation history. This is useful, for example, to inspect user audio after noise cancellation and VAD. The server will respond with a conversation.item.retrieved event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the item to retrieve.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.retrieve.

OBJECT conversation.item.retrieve
{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.retrieve",
    "item_id": "item_003"
}
conversation.item.truncate
Send this event to truncate a previous assistant messageâ€™s audio. The server will produce audio faster than realtime, so this event is useful when the user interrupts to truncate audio that has already been sent to the client but not yet played. This will synchronize the server's understanding of the audio with the client's playback.

Truncating audio will delete the server-side text transcript to ensure there is not text in the context that hasn't been heard by the user.

If successful, the server will respond with a conversation.item.truncated event.

audio_end_ms
integer

Inclusive duration up to which audio is truncated, in milliseconds. If the audio_end_ms is greater than the actual audio duration, the server will respond with an error.

content_index
integer

The index of the content part to truncate. Set this to 0.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the assistant message item to truncate. Only assistant message items can be truncated.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.truncate.

OBJECT conversation.item.truncate
{
    "event_id": "event_678",

    "content_index": 0,
    "audio_end_ms": 1500
}
conversation.item.delete
Send this event when you want to remove any item from the conversation history. The server will respond with a conversation.item.deleted event, unless the item does not exist in the conversation history, in which case the server will respond with an error.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

item_id
string

The ID of the item to delete.

type
string

The event type, must be conversation.item.delete.

OBJECT conversation.item.delete
{
    "event_id": "event_901",
    "type": "conversation.item.delete",
    "item_id": "item_003"
}
response.create
This event instructs the server to create a Response, which means triggering model inference. When in Server VAD mode, the server will create Responses automatically.

A Response will include at least one Item, and may have two, in which case the second will be a function call. These Items will be appended to the conversation history by default.

The server will respond with a response.created event, events for Items and content created, and finally a response.done event to indicate the Response is complete.

The response.create event includes inference configuration like instructions and tools. If these are set, they will override the Session's configuration for this Response only.

Responses can be created out-of-band of the default Conversation, meaning that they can have arbitrary input, and it's possible to disable writing the output to the Conversation. Only one Response can write to the default Conversation at a time, but otherwise multiple Responses can be created in parallel. The metadata field is a good way to disambiguate multiple simultaneous Responses.

Clients can set conversation to none to create a Response that does not write to the default Conversation. Arbitrary input can be provided with the input field, which is an array accepting raw Items and references to existing Items.

event_id
string

Optional client-generated ID used to identify this event.

response.cancel
Send this event to cancel an in-progress response. The server will respond with a response.done event with a status of response.status=cancelled. If there is no response to cancel, the server will respond with an error. It's safe to call response.cancel even if no response is in progress, an error will be returned the session will remain unaffected.

conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed
This event is the output of audio transcription for user audio written to the user audio buffer. Transcription begins when the input audio buffer is committed by the client or server (in server_vad mode). Transcription runs asynchronously with Response creation, so this event may come before or after the Response events.

Realtime API models accept audio natively, and thus input transcription is a separate process run on a separate ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. The transcript may diverge somewhat from the model's interpretation, and should be treated as a rough guide.

input_audio_buffer.speech_started
Sent by the server when in server_vad mode to indicate that speech has been detected in the audio buffer. This can happen any time audio is added to the buffer (unless speech is already detected). The client may want to use this event to interrupt audio playback or provide visual feedback to the user.

The client should expect to receive a input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event when speech stops. The item_id property is the ID of the user message item that will be created when speech stops and will also be included in the input_audio_buffer.speech_stopped event (unless the client manually commits the audio buffer during VAD activation).
